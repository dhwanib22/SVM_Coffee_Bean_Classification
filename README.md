# SVM_Coffee_Bean_Classification

## **Overview:**

Welcome to the world of **coffee bean classification**, where machine learning meets delicious caffeinated potential! This repository uses SVM to accurately classify dry coffee beans into distinct categories, empowering the farmer in Turkey to make informed decisions and impress his coffee-loving audience.

## **Problem Statement:**
To classify whether the bean belongs to class Dermason or Sira using SVM
1) Locate the two types of beans that are most popular according to the data. (More popular == more likes on Instagram)
2) Then, make a classifier that can classify between these two types well. He thinks SVM is a good technique, and suggests you use it. (Cool name, he thinks. That’s why he’s asking you to use it. It’s all for the ‘gram.)
3) He just does not want good classification, he wants you to show that to him as well, through some colorful and suave visualizations of how well the model performed and all that. (How else do you think he’s gonna get all those likes?)

## **Data:**
This repository houses the "Dry Beans" dataset, brimming with features like form, shape, type, and structure of diverse coffee beans.
